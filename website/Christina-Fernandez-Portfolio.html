                <h1>Projects:</h1>
                <p><b>Wordle:</b> During Intro to Computational Thinking, I completed a group project to create a game in Python. We made a wordle game based on Wordle from NYTimes. The game included user input to choose character length. 
                    For each guess the user was given a result to show the user how close their guess was. At the end of the game the user was able to print their stats and see on a bar graph how many guesses they needed for each word length. 
                    The link to the Google Colab containing the code is attached <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Yxsc2rXCribNdv1Tpj8GdFDWWZfVnbHA?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
                <p><b>Encryped Message:</b> I made a message encryption program using C++. This included many functions to shift individual characters, and then shift the whole message. The program allowed for user-input. 
                    The user chose the method of encryption they wanted, either standard 13 key shift, two-key shift, or a shift using a keyword and then input their message to encrypt. The file containing the code for the project is attached 
                <a href="\Users\Christina Fernandez\Downloads\CSCI1300\Project 1\question9.cpp" download="EncryptionProject.cpp">here.</a></p>
                <p><b>Odyssey Game:</b> I made a two-player game using C++. Throughout the game players took turns rolling dice to move across a board game which was displayed at each turn. Different tiles brought different events such as combat, 
                    multiplayer combat, and an anagram that if decoded gave the player a free item. I implemented two classes, Game and Entity, as well as two structs for the Potions and Equipment. There was also a Map class used to display the game board at every turn.
                    The file containing the code for the project is attached <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Q8Cnb0ngpegHh9e1nsoFTfX9f-f05l4p/view?usp=sharing">here.</a></p>
                <p><b>Portfolio Website:</b> My most recent project is this website. I experimented with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to make this, which included reading some articles and watching some videos, and just running the code to see what happened.
                I added some basic functionality such as tabs in the header and links to click on throughout the webpage. I implemented five classes, tabs, tab-content, footer, rows, and container. This is my first experience with front-end development
                and I wanted to learn and try out as much as I could. The file containing the code for the project is attached 
                <a href="\Users\Christina Fernandez\website.zip" download="website.zip">here.</a></p>
                <p><b>File System Simulation:</b> My partner and I made a file system simulation in C++. We stored files and directories in an n-ary tree data structure. We also implemented many Linux commands such as touch, mkdir, mv, rm, edit, and more.
                    We also utilized a hash table to store the files in a secondary location. This allowed for a more efficient search method. We also used three different collision resolution methods: Chaining, Linear Probing, and Quadratic Probing. Lastly, we
                    created tests cases to get data on how the collision resolution method affected the number of collisions in the hash table.
                    My partner and I did this work in our own shared GitHub repository and pulled changes from our personal coding enviroments.</p>
