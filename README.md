Hello, my name is Christina Fernandez.
In this github repository I have attached my personal portfolio website. Please open Christina-Fernandez-Portfolio.html to reach the website.
On the website is mostly information available on my resume, however there are also links to all the code from my projects. Please feel free to download those and take a look.
Additionally, my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code I made for this website are also attached to this repository. Please feel free to look through those as well. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to look at my website.

Christina Fernandez
